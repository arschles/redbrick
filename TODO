- automatically know (based on cmd) what reply type is expected, and "cast" callback response into that reply
    - need to document what each callback needs to return (ie: array for bulk and multi-bulk, etc...)
- support for passing an object into the callback function - just try to call the function that matches the cmd name
    - lookup first in callback dictionary, then in objects (in order they were added) - this enables overrides
- set up jsunit for test suite
- rewrite parser to use state machine instead of current inefficient way
- handle special cases like "QUIT", which don't make sense to allow callbacks for
- create some pre-packaged callback objects
    - trivial redis pass through
    - 100% in memory redis
    - redis proxy w/ zookeeper for key lookups
    - load balancer for resque
- make sure modules are namespaced correctly
- implement streaming callbacks
    - look into using generators for implementing


===DONE===
- get working with JS redis client
